  |   When the moon tore apart, the sky bled red with light, ushering in    |
  |   an apocalyptic new age...and to survive, you must fight. As a         |
  |   mercenary, defend Earth through high-speed combat against corrupted   |
  |   robots in a series of missions from the cockpit of your Arsenal, a    |
  |   fully customizable mech. Equip your Arsenal with a vast array of      |
  |   parts and weapons, obtain more from downed enemy Arsenals, and swap   |
  |   them on the fly to suit your strategy in the face of ever-rising      |
  |   threats.                                                              |

  |   In this brand-new action game from Kenichiro Tsukuda (Armored Core)   |
  |   and mech designer Shoji Kawamori (Super Dimensional Fortress          |
  |   Macross), your environment is your ally. Collect and use Femto        |
  |   Energy on the field to boost your stats and create powerful           |
  |   mirages; or wield objects like cars and street signs as melee         |
  |   weapons and projectiles. For even more power, upgrade your physical   |
  |   combat abilities and learn new skills through body modification.      |
  |   It'll also come in handy when you eject from your Arsenal and fight   |
  |   on foot using special weapons and abilities.                          |
